# Zignite: Cross-Platform Graphics Engine

## Overview

Zignite is a modern graphics engine built with the Zig programming language, designed for cross-platform development with native performance and WebAssembly compatibility. This project leverages Zig's memory safety and performance characteristics to create a robust foundation for interactive applications, games, and visualization tools.

## Goals
â€¢ Build a lightweight, high-performance graphics engine using modern APIs \
â€¢ Explore Zig's compile-time features and manual memory management capabilities \
â€¢ Create seamless cross-platform deployment (native + WebAssembly) \
â€¢ Integrate immediate-mode GUI capabilities with Dear ImGui \
â€¢ Provide a clean, type-safe API for graphics programming \

## Architecture 

Zignite is built around modern graphics APIs and cross-platform libraries: \
â€¢ **WebGPU Backend** â€“ Cross-platform graphics API for native and web targets \
â€¢ **GLFW Integration** â€“ Window management, input handling, and context creation \
â€¢ **Dear ImGui** â€“ Immediate-mode GUI system for developer tools and interfaces \
â€¢ **Engine Core** â€“ Unified rendering loop and resource management \
â€¢ **Emscripten Support** â€“ WebAssembly compilation for browser deployment

## Features

â€¢ Cross-platform rendering with WebGPU (native + web) \
â€¢ Memory-efficient implementation with Zig's allocator system \
â€¢ Integrated Dear ImGui for rapid UI development \
â€¢ WebAssembly compilation for browser deployment \
â€¢ Type-safe graphics API bindings \
â€¢ Minimal dependencies and fast compilation times

## Learning Outcomes

This project provides hands-on experience with: \
â€¢ Zig's comptime features and build system \
â€¢ Manual memory management with custom allocators \
â€¢ Cross-platform graphics programming with WebGPU \
â€¢ C interoperability and binding generation \
â€¢ WebAssembly deployment strategies \
â€¢ Modern graphics pipeline architecture

## Project Status

ðŸš§ **Active Development** â€“ Core engine functionality is implemented with WebGPU + ImGui integration. WebAssembly deployment is supported via Emscripten.
